## Introduction

Hi i'm Beau Carnes with freecodecamp.org. In this course i'm going to teach you how to make a *full stack web application* using the *Mern Stack*. But I'm going to teach you even more than other *Mern Stack* courses, I'm going to show you how to convert the Back-end of the app to Serverless, and how to host it for free in the cloud, so you don't even need *Node or Express*. The *Mern Stack* is a popular stack of technologies for building a *modern single page application*. *Mongodb* is a *document based open source database*.

*Node.js* allows Javascript to run outside a browser in places like a web server. *Express* is a web application framework that makes it simpler to code a web server in javascript. And *React* is a Javascript front-end library for building *user interfaces*. In this course we will be building a *Restaurant Review Web App*. First I will talk about *Mongodb* and how to host your database in the cloud using Mongodb Atlas then I'll show you how to create the Back-end of the app using *Node.js and Express*.

Our Server will interact with the database using the native Mongodb Javascript library instead of the Mongoose library used by many other *Mern Stack* courses. Why use an extra library if you don't have to. Next I will show how to create the Front-end with React and connect the front-end to the back-end at that point the *Mern Stack* app will be complete. But I'll have one more thing to show you in the final part of this course.

I will show you how to replace the *Node-Express* backend with *Mongodb Realm*. This is a serverless platform that will allow us to do everything in the cloud without running our own server, and with a lot less code. Then I'll show you how we can use *Mongodb Realm* to host our React front-end, so our entire web app will be hosted for free on *Mongodb Realm*. If you already know a lot about the *Mern Stack*, just skip and go straight to where I show how to convert the *Node-Express* backend to use *Mongodb Realm* instead.

Let me show you an overview of the structure of the app we're going to build. Over on this side we have the *M* of the *Mern Stack -- Mongodb*. We'll be hosting this on Mongodb Atlas. We also, and then we have the *E* and the *N* this is the backend *Node and Express*. You'll see that *Express* is just part of *Node*, and this is where we're going to be running the our backend server. And then we have our *R* for *React -- front-end*. And we'll be running our *React* on a local server too, inside *Node.js*. And then the Client, which is what people will see when they go to the website, to our web app. So let's start by talking about *Mongodb*.

## MongoDB Overview

First, a quick overview of the *Mongodb database*. In the tabular or relational world, we think of things like databases, tables, rows, etc. *Mongodb* has similar concepts that use different terms. I'd like to make sure everyone is aware of, instead of a *Table*, we have *Collections*, instead of *Rows* we have *Documents*. We can do *join* operations with the *$lookup* operator. And instead of *foreign keys*, we utilize *references*. *Mongodb* is very well suited for handling data with a wide variety of relationships.

Let's have a quick look at the *document model* to see. Here's an example of a *Mongodb document*. It looks very much like *Json*.

```javascript
{
    name: "Mukhtar",
    title: "Developer",
    address: {
        addres 1: "123 Main Street",
        city: "Kano",
        postal_code: "90112"
    },
    projects: ["VimApp", "KasApp"],
    employee_number: 5,
    location: [1.234, 56.789]
    }
```

We can see in here a variety of relationships an *address*, a *title*. Here's the different *data formats* -- we've *string*, *nested document*, *array*, *integer*, and *geo-spatial coordinates*, they're all in the document. Mongodb stores data in *bson format* or *binary json*. This provides for a wide variety of support for data types like *strings or integers*, and in our code we're sometimes going to have to do some converting between *json and binary json*, specifically for the *object id*. Okay let's get started creating our *database*.

## Setup MongoDB Atlas Cloud Database

You can host your Mongodb database locally, but I found that it's easier to host the database using  *Mongodb Atlas*, so we can do everything in the cloud and eventually we will literally do everything in the cloud. Where our entire back-end and front-end is in the cloud. And we can actually do it right all on *Mongodb Atlas*. But for now we're just going to create the database. We'll be using the *free tier on Mongodb Atlas* in this tutorial.

So the first step is to create an account or you can just sign in. So once you're creating your account for the first time, you're going to have to set up the account, so you can create an organization everything's going to have to have an organization. I'll just call this -- *My Org*. For the project name, for our first project, I'm going to put *Mern Stack*. So I'm going to call this the *Mern Stack* project, and preferred language, well we'll be mainly working with Javascript in the *Mern Stack*, so let's go past this.

And then I'm going to choose this *free-tier*. Okay now we're going to be choosing where our our files are going to be stored at. And we can just basically choose all these default options, if we choose these default options it's going to be on the free-tier. You probably want to actually choose a location that's close to where you're at. So if none of these are really close, you can actually check some of these other cloud providers and just kind of pick the one that seems to be closest to where you're currently located.

I'll just keep on the default, and then I'll just do create *cluster*. And you can update the settings depending on what you need, you can actually pay more if you need a bigger *cluster*, but for now when we're just learning it's good to start with the free-version. Okay after the *cluster* is created, you'll have to configure it, so you can connect to it. So click the connect button, and then we're going to have to have a *white-list Ip*, so just add the *current Ip address*.

So, we'll be connecting to it right from our computer, because we're developing the back-end locally, so I'll just add my *current ip address*. And then we'll create a *database user*. So I'll just create it as *my name*, and the password is *mernstack*. We'll choose a connection method, and we'll be connecting through *Mongodb's native drivers*, so this is going to give us the *connection string* we're going to use to connect from *Mongodb and Node.js*.

Now eventually, we'll have to come back and copy this, but for now we'll just leave it, and we'll come back and get this when it's time. When we're doing our code in Node.js and I can just close this for now.

## Load Sample Data into Database

And now we'll add *sample data* to the database. One thing great about *Mongodb Atlas* is that, when you're creating a *demo app* or you're just trying to try things out, there's a lot of *sample data* you can just use so you don't have to do all this work of finding your own *sample data*. So I'm going to click these three dots here and go to load *sample data set*, and then load *sample data set*. And this is actually going to create a bunch of different data sets right within our cluster.

Okay after the *sample data* set is successfully loaded, we can actually use this interface to explore the data sets and see what's in it. So I'm going to click on *collections*, and then these are all the different data sets that are in here. There's *sample_airbnb, sample_analytics, geospatial, mflix, restaurants, supplies, training and weather-data*. For this tutorial we're going to be using the *sample_restaurants* data, and you can see there's the *neighborhoods* data and there's the *restaurants* data.

And if we look at the *restaurants*, we have a list of a bunch of *restaurants* in new york. So this one's called the riviera carrer, I guess I don't know how to pronounce it. So it's gonna show the *cuisine* and the *burrow*, and then there's also going to be an *address* for each *restaurant*. So we are going to be using this data in our app so let's start creating our app. We're going to start creating our *back-ends*.

## Create Node / Express Backend

So I'm going to go over to the terminal. I've already created a folder called *restaurant-reviews*. And I'm going to just make sure I have the right version of *node*, and so that's going to be a good version, *v14.18.2*. And now we are going to first start with our back-end. We're going to start by creating the back-end of the app with *nodejs and express*, and then we'll create the front-end with *react*, and then like I said in the final section, we'll switch out the *node.js-express backend with Mongodb Realm*.

So inside this root folder i'm going to create a new folder called backend and then i'll switch into it okay now that i'm in this folder i'm going to we're going to create a package.json file inside this folder by running npm init and then okay we've initiated our package.json file since we're going to be using node here and now we're going to install a few dependencies so we'll do npm install we're going to do express cores mongodb and dot env so let me tell you a little bit about these so express is going to be what we use for the the web server it's going to help us make the web server cores stands for cross-origin resource sharing and it allows ajax requests to skip the same origin policy and access resources from remote hosts the course package provides an express middleware that can enable cores with different options basically it's going to make it so we can make the right connections on our network that we need to make without that we could have some errors and then the mongodb dependency allows us to interact with our mongodb database the emv dependency loads environmental
