Don't forget it is a hidden file inside your home directory (you would not be the first to do a ls -l and thinking it is not there).

Do a: ls -la ~/ | more to see if the file exist, then vim ~/.bashrc

You need to modify PS1 in your shell startup file (probably .bashrc).

If it's there already, its setting will contain \w, which is what gives your working directory.
Change that to \W (upper case). The line in bashrc file looks like below:
PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\W\[\033[00m\]\$ '
Log out and in again
